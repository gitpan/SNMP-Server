1.001 -> 1.002

If a log file was being continually replenished (e.g. if you're
"tailing" /dev/ttyS0), the script would never terminate. This has now
been fixed.

1.002 -> 1.003

Fixed broken dependencies on other modules.

1.003 -> 1.004

It appears that some forms of log rotation aren't the traditional
rename+SIGHUP to the daemon, and the i-number doesn't change. Since
only a change of i-number was checked, the logfile rotation wasn't
noticed. The rotation check now includes a test to see if the logfile
was truncated.

Some clients increment counters past 2**32, and we were blindly
passing these invalid values back as COUNTER32. Now we mask to 32 bits
since these values are expected to wrap around.
